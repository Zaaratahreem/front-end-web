        </strong>
        Originally based on a rural European life,it was developed throughout the 2010s and was first named cottagecore on Tumblr in 2018. The aesthetic centres on traditional rural clothing, interior design, and crafts such as drawing, baking, and pottery, and is related to similar aesthetic movements such as grandmacore, goblincore, gnomecore and fairycore.
        Some sources describe cottagecore as a subculture of Millennials and Generation Z. Economic forces and other challenges facing these young people may be a significant driver of this trend, along with these generations' emphasis on sustainability, and the trend to work from home.

            The tenets of cottagecore can help its proponents satisfy a desire for "an aspirational form of nostalgia" as well as an escape from many forms of stress and trauma.The New York Times described it as a reaction to hustle culture and the advent of personal branding. The Guardian called it a <em> visual and lifestyle movement designed to fetishize the wholesome purity of the outdoors.</em> Cottagecore emphasizes simplicity and the soft peacefulness of the pastoral life as an escape from the dangers of the modern world. It became highly popular on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic.

        An early inspiration for cottagecore fashion is mori girl, which reached popularity in Japan in the late 2000s.Lolita fashion, another Japanese street fashion with a soft silhouette and a Victorian-inspired look might have been another early inspiration. While homemade clothing is a feature of cottagecore,products including the 'strawberry dress', a $490 tea dress by Lirika Matoshi, are also associated with the aesthetic.Due to the high price of the Matoshi dress, a number of people produced their own versions of the product.Cottagecore clothing often includes long layered dresses.
